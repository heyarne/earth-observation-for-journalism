# Overview

Following the explorations about how spectral indices can be calculated, this chapter aims to calculate burn areas for different forest fires in Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in 2018 and 2019.

While there are Copernicus services that provide forest fire observation services, a lot of the fires during the active wild fire season in Germany are not covered by them. Nevertheless these fires have lasting impacts in their ecosystems and are a contributor to CO2 emissions worldwide, which serves as the motivation to see if additional information can be gained by looking closely at the Sentinel-2 data.

After an evaluation of the feasibility of a detailed look at the entire area of Brandenburg for an entire year this chapter defines three forest fires of interest for which media coverage during the active fire as well as government reports at a later point provide sufficient information. It goes on to analyze the Copernicus data to see if media coverage during the active fire could have been improved by incorporating Sentinel-2 data.
